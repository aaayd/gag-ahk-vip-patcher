# Troubleshooting

- [ ] Downloaded **latest** macro version  
- [ ] AutoHotkey version is **1.1** (⚠️ *not* 2.2)  
- [ ] Running **windowed mode** (don’t go full-screen)  
- [ ] Extracted the macro ZIP before use  
- [ ] **“Recall Wrench”** is in the **2nd hot-bar slot** — macro may bug out if it has to move it  
- [ ] **5–10 items** present in your hot-bar  
- [ ] **UI Navigation** enabled in Roblox settings  
- [ ] **“Grey mouse” pet unequipped** — its speed bonus breaks the macro
