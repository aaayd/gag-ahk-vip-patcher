## How to Run

1. **Option A – Pre-built executable**  

Grab the latest release from the Releases page.
Run the downloaded .exe; it will drop Main-patched.ahk next to it.
This creates a new file called Main-patched.ahk in the same directory.

2. **Option B – Python script**  
   ```bash
   python patcher.py
   ```
   
This creates a new file called Main-patched.ahk in the same directory.

# Troubleshooting

- [ ] Downloaded **latest** macro version  
- [ ] AutoHotkey version is **1.1** (⚠️ *not* 2.2)  
- [ ] Running **windowed mode** (don’t go full-screen)  
- [ ] Extracted the macro ZIP before use  
- [ ] **“Recall Wrench”** is in the **2nd hot-bar slot** — macro may bug out if it has to move it  
- [ ] **5–10 items** present in your hot-bar  
- [ ] **UI Navigation** enabled in Roblox settings  
- [ ] **“Grey mouse” pet unequipped** — its speed bonus breaks the macro
